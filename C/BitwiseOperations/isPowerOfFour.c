/*
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:

Input: 16
Output: true

/*
METHOD 2 Explained:
Let's first check if num is a power of two: x > 0 and x & (x - 1) == 0.

Now the problem is to distinguish between even powers of two (when xx is a power of four) and 
odd powers of two (when xx is not a power of four). 

In binary representation both cases are single 1-bit followed by zeros.
What is the difference? 
In the first case (power of four), 1-bit is at even position: bit 0, bit 2, bit 4, etc. 
In the second case, at odd position: bit 1, bit 3, bit 5, bit 7 etc.

Case: Power of 4: 1 bit which is at even position i.e. bit 0, bit 2, bit 4, bit 6
x = 1    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
x = 4    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
x = 16   0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
x = 64   0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0

Case: Power of 2, which is NOT power of 4: 1 bit which is at odd position i.e. bit 1, bit 3, bit 5, bit 7
x = 2     0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
x = 8     0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
x = 32    0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
x = 128   1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Hence power of four would make a zero in a bitwise AND with number 0b101010...10:
4^a ^ (0b101010...10) == 0

How long should be (101010...10)_2
if xx is a signed integer? 32 bits. To write shorter, in 8 charaters instead of 32, 
it's common to use hexadecimal representation: 0b101010...10 = 0xaaaaaaaa

â€‹x & (0xaaaaaaaa) ==0

Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity : O(1).
Space complexity : O(1).
