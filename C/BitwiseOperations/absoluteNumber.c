/*
So in practice "absolute value" means to remove any negative sign in front of a number, 
and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero). NO NEGATIVES !
The absolute value of −9 is 9
The absolute value of 3 is 3
The absolute value of 0 is 0
The absolute value of −156 is 156

Solution:
    If branching is not allowed, we can use following expression to compute absolute value.
    Expression: ((number + mask) ^ mask), where mask = (number >> 31)
    The mask (number >> 31) will be evaluated to 0 for positive numbers.
    The mask (number >> 31) will be evaluated to -1 for negative numbers.

Explanation:
    for positive integers, mask will be 0 and ((number + 0) ^ 0) = number.
    for negative integers: mask will be -1 and ((number + (-1)) ^ (-1)) = number.
        We know, we store negative of a number in 2's compliment form.
        i.e. we flip all the bits from its positive counterpart and add 1 to it.
        Now to get positive counterpart of a negative number, we substract 1 from it and
        flip its bits.
