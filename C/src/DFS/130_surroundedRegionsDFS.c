/*
Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

Example:

X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
Explanation:

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of cells in the board. 
In the worst case where it contains only the O cells on the board, 
we would traverse each cell twice: once during the DFS traversal and the other time during the cell reversion in the last step.

Space Complexity: O(N) where N is the number of cells in the board. 
There are mainly two places that we consume some additional memory.

We keep a list of border cells as starting points for our traversal.
We could consider the number of border cells is proportional to the total number (NN) of cells.

During the recursive calls of DFS() function, we would consume some space in the function call stack, 
i.e. the call stack will pile up along with the depth of recursive calls. 
And the maximum depth of recursive calls would be NN as in the worst scenario mentioned in the time complexity.

As a result, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is \mathcal{O}(N)O(N).
