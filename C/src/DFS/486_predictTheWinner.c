/**
 * Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. 
 * Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. 
 * Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. 
 * This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.
 * Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 *      Input: [1, 5, 2]
 *      Output: False
 *      Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
 *      If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. 
 *      If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
 *      So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
 *      Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 *      Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
 *      Output: True
 *      Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. 
 *      No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
 *      Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *      1 <= length of the array <= 20.
 *      Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
 *      If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.
