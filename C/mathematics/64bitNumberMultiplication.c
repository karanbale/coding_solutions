/*
Multiply two 64 bit numbers such that result will be 128-bit number.
But what if we want to multiply two 64-bit numbers and there is no 128-bit type?
Then we need to do the multiplication by hand. To do that, we split both number in two 32-bit parts.
Let's write "<< 32" as "* shift" to make this easier to read.
Basically if we write the first number as a1 shift + a0 and the second number as b1 shift + b0, then the product is

  (a1 shift + a0) * (b1 shift + b0) ==
  a1 b1 shift shift + a1 b0 shift + a0 b1 shift + a0 b0

The first term is shifted by 64 bits, so if both a1 and b1 are nonzero, we have an overflow right there and can abort.

For the second and third part we do the 32x32->64 multiplication we just used to check for overflow for 32-bit numbers.
This is shifted by 32 bits, so we have an overflow if the upper half of it is nonzero.
Since we already know that either a1 or b1 is zero, we can simply calculate

  a=(uint64_t)(a1)*b0+(uint64_t)(a0)*b1;

At least one half of this term will be zero, so we can't have an overflow in the addition.
Then, if a > 0xffffffff, we have an overflow in the multiplication and can abort.

If we got this far, the result is

  (a << 32) + (uint64_t)(a0)*b0;
We still need to check for overflow in this addition (thanks to Tomi JylhÃ¤-Ollila for pointing this out).
Then we can return the result.
